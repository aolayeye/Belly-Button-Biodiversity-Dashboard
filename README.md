# Belly-Button-Biodiversity-Dashboard
## Overview
The goal of this project is to visualize belly button microbial data. To identify a vaiable alternative source of beef, improbable beef has decided to gather data from volunteers and determine whether their belly button could be the potential source of bacteria species that can be synthesized to make beef alternative. 

Improbable beef has gathered demographic and belly button data from 153 volunteers. We will use this data to create visualization that will help easily identify people that may have bacteria that can be used to synthesize beef. At the end of the analysis, we will produce a bar chart that visualises the top 10 bacterial species found in the belly buttons of the volunteers, a bubble chart that emphasises bacterial species with the highest concentration per individual, and a gauge chart that displays belly washing frequency per week for each volunteer. If Improbable Beef identifies a bacterial species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, our Visualization will help to identify whether that species is found in the navel of anyone of the volunteers.

### Control Flow
1.  reate a folder structure to hold the index.html file, and the JavaScript files
2.  Create a basic HTML page to view the belly button JSON data
      - The HTML page will hold a dropdown panel for the volunteer ID and their corresponding demographic data
      - two columns that will hold a horizontal bar chart and a gauge chart
      - a row to dsiplay a bubble chart
3.  Create a JavaScript to read the JSON data     
4.  Load and inspect the belly button JSON data using the JavaScript, and Web browser's console log
5.  create an event listener to check for changes in the volunteer ID
6.
